  - Thesis: “Design and optimization of a three-fingered robotic hand.”
  - Advisor: Dr. hab. inż. Jacek Łubiński
  - Abstract: This research aimed to design a new robotic hand by considering the safety and manufacturing function, but with higher quality and higher efficiency, by changing the mechanism to be a mass production product and reducing the irrecoverable injuries. In addition, this product can be installed on industrial robots to grasp objects and object movements. A three-fingered robotic hand was designed using SolidWorks software, and the final product was assembled using three sub-assemblies. The CAD model of the product was analyzed in terms of motion (Rigid Dynamics), grasp, and static structural analysis in ANSYS software. The motion and grasp analysis showed that the newly selected mechanism can function, and the three fingers can grasp and hold differently shaped and sized objects. Pressure sensors were utilized in this project to gain better accuracy regarding pressure applied by robotic fingers. The static structural analysis showed the stress distributed on the critical components in worst-case scenarios, and all the components were safe. The robotic hand also has an arm base that can be extended to reach objects at higher distances.

  - Thesis: “Design and fabrication of a mechanical hand.”
  - Advisor: Mr. Harris Wahyudi
  - Abstract: The project aimed to design a mechanical hand to replace the human hand in dangerous workplaces such as manufacturing lines (working with machines) or laboratories. The objective was to design a five-fingered hand with a completely mechanical mechanism that can be connected to the human hand and move objects of different sizes and high strength. Different materials were proposed, and the most efficient material was chosen by considering requirements and constraints. The prototype of the designed mechanical hand was fabricated and experimented in terms of strength, heat, and motion. The CAD model of the mechanical hand's critical components was also simulated using ANSYS software, and mathematical calculations regarding the finite element method were performed to compare the results and increase their accuracy. The final product met the objective set for this project, and the new mechanical hand design can protect the human hand and reduce irrecoverable injuries during work, resisting high stress and temperature.
