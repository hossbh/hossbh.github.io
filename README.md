**Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant** | [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/), USA | Jan 2022 - Present

#### Research Assistant:

#### Project: An Integrated Holistic Approach Toward Sustainable Product Design Using Life Cycle Assessment
- Integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) and design for sustainability (DfS) methods, achieving a 25% environmental, social, and economic sustainability improvement.
- Summary: Sustainable product design addresses sustainability challenges through product development processes and tools. The number of sustainable design methods has been increasing rapidly in recent years, but their adoption is limited, and many of these methods exclusively focus on the environmental impacts of products rather than taking a holistic perspective that includes social and economic sustainability. This research provides a holistic, sustainable design framework by integrating change propagation methods and sustainable design tools to enable simultaneous consideration of design parameters' impacts on the three dimensions of sustainability. A reusable water bottle is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed holistic sustainable design (HSD) framework. A multi-domain matrix (MDM) is used to capture the interdependencies among these design parameters of the product, and then equations are defined to quantify them. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is then automated to evaluate the product's environmental impacts, and the investigation of its results provides details to identify critical unit processes contributing to the environmental categories. Sensitivity analyses reveal how changes to individual design parameters propagate through the model to influence the three dimensions of sustainability. Ultimately, the designer can select optimal design parameter values that can balance environmental, social, and economic sustainability.

#### Project: A Machine Learning Approach for Prediction of Material Categories of 3D CAD Parts
- Enhanced the sustainability of engineering design systems by developing a random forest ML model to predict sustainable materials with 81% accuracy.
- Summary: The material selection process of components remains a critical design step, requiring diverse knowledge to balance mechanical, economic, and environmental considerations. This research introduces a novel approach that leverages machine learning methods to predict the material category of 3D-designed parts. Focusing on Fusion 360 assembly data comprising 8,251 assemblies and 154,468 parts, the research explores the possibility of finding the associated material category of 3D CAD models based on their given geometrical and assembly data. The methodology section outlines a two-phase approach, encompassing data collection and the development of a machine learning prediction model. The data set's comprehensive structure, including assembly hierarchies, joints, contacts, and other physical properties, is detailed. The cleaning process ensures data accuracy and consistency, classifying material categories into seven types. Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared based on their performances to provide the highest accuracy and avoid overfitting and underfitting of the model. The feature selection and hyper-parameters tuning processes were also included to achieve iterative improvement of the model. The results provided show that the final random forest model can reach 81% accuracy in predicting the material categories for the CAD models.

#### Project: A Systems Thinking Approach Toward Sustainable Product Design
- Implemented a novel systems thinking approach toward new product development and interviewed field experts to generate a causal loop diagram (CLD), leading to understanding the reinforcing and balancing loops within the system.
- Summary: Sustainable product design requires new perspectives and methods to achieve environmental, social, and economic success. The multi-agent, multi-variable, complex environment in which stakeholders of a product coexist creates a complex system, which is known as the wicked problem of sustainability. This article aims to generate a systems understanding of the forces and dynamics underlying the wicked problem of sustainable design by applying systems thinking methods to design a relatively simple product: a reusable water bottle. The design variables and the product's life cycle stages are systematically identified and mapped out. The dynamic relationships among these variables and the key stakeholders are formulated into a causal loop diagram (CLD), with directions of change identified to form balancing and reinforcing loops. To validate the CLD representation, interviews with systems thinking experts are conducted to solicit feedback and input to create a more complete system dynamics understanding and framing of the sustainable design of a reusable water bottle. This systems approach highlights the complexities and critical drivers involved or introduced into sustainable product design, in addition to the level of simplicity and complexity of the product. The findings provide a new comprehensive sustainable product design system representation with implications for product development practice, corporate strategy, and public policy.

  - Abstract: This research aimed to design a new robotic hand by considering the safety and manufacturing function, but with higher quality and higher efficiency, by changing the mechanism to be a mass production product and reducing the irrecoverable injuries. In addition, this product can be installed on industrial robots to grasp objects and object movements. A three-fingered robotic hand was designed using SolidWorks software, and the final product was assembled using three sub-assemblies. The CAD model of the product was analyzed in terms of motion (Rigid Dynamics), grasp, and static structural analysis in ANSYS software. The motion and grasp analysis showed that the newly selected mechanism can function, and the three fingers can grasp and hold differently shaped and sized objects. Pressure sensors were utilized in this project to gain better accuracy regarding pressure applied by robotic fingers. The static structural analysis showed the stress distributed on the critical components in worst-case scenarios, and all the components were safe. The robotic hand also has an arm base that can be extended to reach objects at higher distances.

The objective was to design a five-fingered hand with a completely mechanical mechanism that can be connected to the human hand and move objects of different sizes and high strength. Different materials were proposed, and the most efficient material was chosen by considering requirements and constraints. The prototype of the designed mechanical hand was fabricated and experimented in terms of strength, heat, and motion. The CAD model of the mechanical hand's critical components was also simulated using ANSYS software, and mathematical calculations regarding the finite element method were performed to compare the results and increase their accuracy. The final product met the objective set for this project, and the new mechanical hand design can protect the human hand and reduce irrecoverable injuries during work, resisting high stress and temperature.
