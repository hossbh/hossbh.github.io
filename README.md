#### Research Assistant:

#### Project: An Integrated Holistic Approach Toward Sustainable Product Design Using Life Cycle Assessment
Summary: Sustainable product design addresses sustainability challenges through product development processes and tools. The number of sustainable design methods has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Still, their adoption is limited, and many of these methods exclusively focus on the environmental impacts of products rather than taking a holistic perspective that includes social and economic sustainability. This research provides a holistic, sustainable design framework by integrating change propagation methods and sustainable design tools to enable simultaneous consideration of design parameters' impacts on the three dimensions of sustainability. A reusable water bottle is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed holistic sustainable design (HSD) framework. A multi-domain matrix (MDM) is used to capture the interdependencies among these design parameters of the product, and then equations are defined to quantify them. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is then automated to evaluate the product's environmental impacts, and the investigation of its results provides details to identify critical unit processes contributing to the environmental categories. Sensitivity analyses reveal how changes to individual design parameters propagate through the model to influence the three dimensions of sustainability. Ultimately, the designer can select optimal design parameter values that balance environmental, social, and economic sustainability.

#### Project: A Machine Learning Approach for Prediction of Material Categories of 3D CAD Parts
Summary: The material selection process of components remains a critical design step, requiring diverse knowledge to balance mechanical, economic, and environmental considerations. This research introduces a novel approach that leverages machine learning methods to predict the material category of 3D-designed parts. Focusing on Fusion 360 assembly data comprising 8,251 assemblies and 154,468 parts, the research explores the possibility of finding the associated material category of 3D CAD models based on their given geometrical and assembly data. The methodology section outlines a two-phase approach, encompassing data collection and the development of a machine learning prediction model. The data set's comprehensive structure, including assembly hierarchies, joints, contacts, and other physical properties, is detailed. The cleaning process ensures data accuracy and consistency, classifying material categories into seven types. Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared based on their performances to provide the highest accuracy and avoid overfitting and underfitting of the model. The feature selection and hyper-parameters tuning processes were also included to achieve iterative improvement of the model. The results obtained from this analysis show that the final random forest model can reach 81% accuracy in predicting the material categories for the CAD models.

#### Project: A Systems Engineering Approach Toward Sustainable Product Design
Summary: Sustainable product design requires new perspectives and methods to achieve environmental, social, and economic success. The multi-agent, multi-variable, complex environment in which stakeholders of a product coexist creates a complex system, which is known as the wicked problem of sustainability. This article aims to generate a systems understanding of the forces and dynamics underlying the wicked problem of sustainable design by applying systems thinking methods to design a relatively simple product: a reusable water bottle. The design variables and the product's life cycle stages are systematically identified and mapped out. The dynamic relationships among these variables and the key stakeholders are formulated into a causal loop diagram (CLD), with directions of change identified to form balancing and reinforcing loops. To validate the CLD representation, interviews with systems thinking experts are conducted to solicit feedback and input to create a more complete system dynamics understanding and framing of the sustainable design of a reusable water bottle. This systems approach highlights the complexities and critical drivers involved or introduced into sustainable product design. The CLD is used to generate a stock and flow model that can simulate different scenarios over time and reveal the underlying dynamic behavior of this complex system. The findings provide a new comprehensive sustainable product design system representation with implications for product development practice, corporate strategy, and public policy.

#### Project: A Survey Study Identifying the Characteristics of Sustainable Design System
Summary: To achieve sustainability, a holistic sustainable system requires a balance of social, economic, and environmental dimensions. This multi-dimensional system has multiple stakeholders with different objectives acting within the system, thus resulting in a complex system. Product design is one of the approaches toward achieving sustainability, which is also influenced by policies. Product designers/managers and policymakers have been identified as critical stakeholders within this complex system, and their decisions directly affect the transition toward sustainable product design. However, these stakeholders have different perspectives on sustainability, and this research aims to find a detailed and unified understanding of their perspectives. An online survey investigated the views of engineers/managers and policymakers in the United States to better understand stakeholder's definitions of sustainability, sustainability assessment, drivers, and barriers to sustainability. Finally, the participants are asked to identify their requirements for a sustainable design tool that can assist them effectively in designing a sustainable product. A total of 50 participants were surveyed in this study, and their responses were analyzed qualitatively. The results provide a comprehensive view of this complex system's current state and future requirements for sustainable design tools. The perspectives of these two critical stakeholders are investigated to understand their frame of reference and identify their needs for sustainable product design and policy-making.

#### Project: Identification of Variables Impacting Cascading Failures in Aerospace Systems: A Natural Language Processing Approach
Summary: The emergence of new technological advancements increases the complexity level of systems, such as those in aerospace, resulting in unpredictable behaviors. Systems engineering practices have been extensively used to conceptualize different complex problem domains and reveal the underlying patterns in systems. Tools such as causal loop diagrams (CLD) are implemented to identify reinforcing and balancing loops within a system, along with quantitative techniques such as stock and flow models. Identifying critical variables in a complex system is challenging, and it prevents the domain expert from developing a systematic approach to the problem definition. To address this challenge, a natural language processing (NLP) approach has been applied to aircraft accident reports to systematically identify variables and assist the domain expert in generating a CLD. The accident report data is analyzed using a large language model (LLM) Llama 2 to determine the cause of accidents and categorize risks in this system. The critical variables associated with the cascading failures in aerospace systems are extracted using topic modeling techniques. The keywords in each topic were assigned to different risk categories based on the coherence analysis. The results generated a CLD that underscores this system's feedback loops. The findings highlight NLP's applications in systems engineering methods and its contribution to the risk assessment of aerospace systems.

- Advisor: Dr. Roshanak Nilchiani & Dr. Steven Hoffenson
- Abstract: The number of sustainable design methods emerging in recent years has increased due to global environmental concerns. Several proposed methods focus exclusively on the environmental impacts of products rather than taking a holistic perspective that includes social and economic sustainability. Despite the advancements in tools for incorporating sustainability in the product design phase, designers are not universally adopting these tools mainly due to their fragmented or underdeveloped characteristics. This research aims to integrate change propagation and sustainable design tools within a holistic framework that can enable simultaneous consideration of design parameters' impacts on the three dimensions of sustainability. A reusable water bottle is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed holistic, sustainable design framework. The interdependencies among these design parameters are captured using a multi-domain matrix (MDM), and then equations are defined to quantify these dependencies. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is then performed in an automated way to evaluate the product's environmental impacts, and the investigation of its results provides details to identify critical unit processes contributing to the environmental categories. Using this framework, sensitivity analyses are able to reveal how changes to individual design parameters propagate through the model to influence the three dimensions of sustainability.

In addition, this product can be installed on industrial robots to grasp objects and object movements. A three-fingered robotic hand was designed using SolidWorks software, and the final product was assembled using three sub-assemblies. The CAD model of the product was analyzed in terms of motion (Rigid Dynamics), grasp, and static structural analysis in ANSYS software. The motion and grasp analysis showed that the newly selected mechanism can function, and the three fingers can grasp and hold differently shaped and sized objects. Pressure sensors were utilized in this project to gain better accuracy regarding pressure applied by robotic fingers. The static structural analysis showed the stress distributed on the critical components in worst-case scenarios, and all the components were safe. The robotic hand also has an arm base that can be extended to reach objects at higher distances.

## Other Projects

#### Project: Assessing Systemic Drivers and Barriers to Sustainable Design Transitions
Summary: The sustainable design transition has proven to be a challenging process, in part due to the diverse set of stakeholders, which includes the general public, policymakers, scientific researchers, and businesses.
In prior work, the interconnected relationships among systematic drivers and barriers for sustainable design were identified and mapped using a causal loop diagram at a relatively abstract level. To further understand and characterize this complex system, this research aims to determine the relationship strength levels among the variables in the system, as indicated by previous research identified in the literature. In addition, the knowledge maturity levels of these identified relationships are specified to illustrate strengths and gaps in the literature. The findings are used to create a refined system representation that demonstrates the power dynamics between systemic driving forces to sustainable design transitions. The results of this work reveal valuable insights about the linkages among the driving forces of sustainable design transitions that can be used as a foundation for further investigation, such as experiments and data analytics that can better quantify these relationships.

#### Project: European and North American Migration Network Analysis: Gini Index and Political Regimes
Summary: The study of human migration patterns and their socio-economic impacts is essential in the current state of the world. These migrations have increased with the globalization over the past decade. The push and pull factors that influence these migration patterns have not been studied through the lens of social network analysis. This research utilizes social network analysis methods to reveal the economic and political impacts on migrations by focusing on European and North American countries. The UN migration data are used along with the World Bank’s Gini index data to capture
the economic aspects of the network. In addition, the regimes of the world categorization are used to investigate the impact of political regimes on these migration networks. Social network analysis methods were applied to understand the underlying behavior of these migrations. The results showed a positive correlation between the average centrality score of the nodes in the network and the average Gini index of countries, indicating the high migration to countries with lower income equality. Moreover, a positive correlation exists between average centrality and liberal democratic countries. The results of this research can guide future policy-making processes toward controlling the migration network.

#### Project: Decision Support System Utilizing Multi-Attribute Utility Theory: Find My Beer [Try it!](https://caddell.shinyapps.io/find_my_beer/)
Summary: This project aimed to develop a novel decision support system (DSS) to help users identify their top five beers. Web-scraping and data cleaning methods were implemented to collect a dataset of more than 6,000 beers, and a multi-attribute utility model was designed to identify the users' preferences. Five attributes were selected: style, alcohol by volume (ABV), international bitterness unit (IBU), rating, and novelty. The utility function implemented could define the user's preferences, and the swing weight method was utilized for each attribute. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to test the novelty of the beers. The model can successfully recommend the top five beers based on user preferences.
